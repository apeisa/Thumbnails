How to install
==============

Just add files and folders to your site/modules/ folder and install one of the modules (it installs others). After that create new field or edit existing image field and make it use fieldtype "CropImage".

You can change the settings for each field in the Setup->Files->CropImageField Input tab:

thumbnail,100,100
portrait,100,150
largethumb,200,200,basic-page,home


Usage on templates
==================

FieldtypeCropImage adds getThumb-method to Pageimage. getThumb returns url to the thumbnail you have asked for, ie:
echo $page->cropImages->eq(0)->getThumb('thumbnail');

If you haven't cropped that thumbnail yet, this module provides default cropping from center
